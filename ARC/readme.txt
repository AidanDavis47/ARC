TO DO LIST:

and probably want a bunch of other stuff that we will figure out later

really late things to do
1. get the webserver connected
2. get a database to store info
3. have our app read/write to the data base



KNOWN BUG LIST:
when swithcing to ar screen from main camera goes black, tap function and cube making functions still occur and work as expected you just can see anything

GPS coordinates are currently not working on aidans phone, restricted somehow, it should work but getting error "The operation couldn't be completed. (kCLErrorDomain error 1.)'" supposedly it is because authorization in plist is not allowed but i checked and it is allowed. Maybe test on different phone to see if it is just a one phone bug?
